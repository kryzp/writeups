# Zelda
I'm personally obsessed with the Zelda games. Might be because its literally the first "real" game I ever played as a kid (shout out to "A Link to the past (3DS)" and "Windwaker"), but either way, I love seeing how they work.  

Luckily, many people share that interest because the Zelda franchise might just be the single most heavily decompiled game franchise... ever? There's Ocarina of Time which recently hit a perfect 1:1 with the games C codebase (as in, they've 100% decompiled the game into real, human-readable, C. I cannot stress how much of an achievement that is), Majora's Mask is also underway, so is the Minish Cap, Twilight Princess and possibly most boldly: Breath of the Wild.

I'm just a fan of certain things that get implemented (and *how* they're implemented) in the games. So naturally, I try to re-create them.
